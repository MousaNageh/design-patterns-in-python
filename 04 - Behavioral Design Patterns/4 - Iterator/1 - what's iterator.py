'''
The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
without exposing its underlying representation. 
The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

The main idea behind the Iterator Pattern is to take the responsibility of access and traversal out of the aggregate 
object and put it into an iterator object. The Iterator defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements. 
By doing this, the aggregate can remain focused on the complexities of managing the collection,
while the iterator provides a standard way to cycle through the elements of the collection.
