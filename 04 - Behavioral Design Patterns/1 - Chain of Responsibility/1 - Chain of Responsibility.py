'''
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. 
This pattern is particularly useful for creating a pipeline of processing units/handlers where each unit handles the task if it's capable, 
or otherwise, passes it to the next handler in the line.
